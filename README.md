I created POMODORO thanks to python 100 days bootcamp course on UDEMY. I have followed instructions. However, I did it differently and added some features.
To start the time press start. It will automatically start the clock. After working for 25 minutes, it will give let you know when to take 5 minutes break. Every 4th break will be 20 minutes long.
Hope it will help you too to keep motivated and productive!
